As it is seen from the outputs above, there is a difference in number of puchases between two different bidding methods. Which difference is going to be checked whether it is statistically significant or not.\n\n## A/B Testing (Independent two sample t-test)\n\nIndependent two sample t-test: It is used to compare the means of two different groups. Independent two sample t-test aims to prove the observed difference between means is statistically and significantly different. The analysis should start with (1) setting up the hypothesis and followed by (2) checking the assumptions and (3) interpretation of the p-value.\n\n### Hypothesis of the A/B Test\n\nH0: µ1 = µ2 <br />\nH1: µ1 != µ2 \n\n## Assumptions\n\n- 1. Normality Assumption: Distributions of the data groups should be normally distributed. Outlier analsis is important to get normally distributed sample (sahpiro-wilks test). Shapiro-wilks test checks whether there is a statistical diffirence between standard normal distribution and distribution of the variable.\n\n    H0: Variable is normally distributed.<br />\n    H1: Variable is not normally distributed.\n    \n- 2. Variance Homogeneity: Levene test is used to cehck the variance homogeneity, it checks the homogeneity of the considered two samples, in other words it checks the similarity of the variances of the considered two samples.\n\n    H0: Variances are homogenous.<br />\n    H1: Variances are not homogenous.\n\nIf these assumptions are fulfilled, independent two sample t-test (parametric test) should be implemented. Otherwise, mannwihtneyu test (non-parametric test) should be implemented.\n\nIf normality assumption is not fulfilled, samples should be analysed with mannwhitneyu test. If variance homogeneity is not observed, samples are analysed with independent two sample t-test by changing the parameter (equal_var = False).   \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking normality assumption\ntest_stat, pvalue = shapiro(cont_df[\"Purchase\"])\nprint(\"Test Stat = %.4f, p-value = %4f\" % (test_stat, pvalue))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-21T16:37:13.442284Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-21T16:37:13.443121Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-21T16:37:13.44929Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-21T16:37:13.443078Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-21T16:37:13.448383Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_stat, pvalue = shapiro(test_df[\"Purchase\"])\nprint(\"Test Stat = %.4f, p-value = %4f\" % (test_stat, pvalue))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-21T16:37:28.672974Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-21T16:37:28.673317Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-21T16:37:28.678635Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-21T16:37:28.673288Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-21T16:37:28.677725Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Findings show that H0 can not be rejected (p>0.05) for both of the variables, which means that both variables are normally distributed.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking variance homogeneity \ntest_stat, pvalue = stats.levene(cont_df[\"Purchase\"], test_df[\"Purchase\"])\nprint(\"Test Stat = %.4f, p-value = %.4f\" % (test_stat, pvalue))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-21T16:50:01.947015Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-21T16:50:01.947382Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-21T16:50:01.955354Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-21T16:50:01.947342Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-21T16:50:01.954304Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Finding show that H0 can not be rejected, so the variables have equal variances.
