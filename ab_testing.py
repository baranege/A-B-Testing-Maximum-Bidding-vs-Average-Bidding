# A/B TESTING PROJCT

# Case: Firm A introduced an alternative method for bidding which is called 
# average bidding for the previous bidding method, which is called maximum bidding. 
# A Client of the Firm A wants to test the efficiency of this alternative method 
# with A/B test, whether average bidding brings greater reaction rates than 
# maximum bidding or not.

print('Test Stat = %.4f, p-value = %.4f' % (test_stat, pvalue))
# don't reject null hypothesis, two independent samples have identical means.

# Task 3: Which test is used? Why?

# Both of the samples have been normally distributed and they have equal variances
# Proceeded with independent two sample t-test

# Task 4: Recommendations for the customer

# P-value is greater that 0.3493, so the observed two samples have
# identical average values with 95% confidence level. This means that there is 
# no statistically significant differnce between conversion rates of maximum bidding 
# and average bidding. The reccommendation would be continuing with maximum bidding 
# while perfoming further analysis until finding a differnt result.
